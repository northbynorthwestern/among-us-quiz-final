    <center> <p> You tend to be underestimated. You tend to be a great <br> impostor that kills without holding back, but when youâ€™re a <br> crewmate you are determined to find the impostor and do not <br> trust anyone to be safe. People tend to point the finger at you <br> when you are innocent, yet you somehow manage to get by <br> undetected when caught venting or killing someone.
