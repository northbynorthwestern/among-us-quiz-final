        <center> <p> Whenever you join the server, we all know you’re not going to last long – you either end up being ejected from the room randomly or you’re the first one dead. If you do miraculously manage to stay in the game, you usually end up being accused by others as the impostor. Even if you try to defend yourself, it just incriminates you further. At least you can thrive as the impostor! Happy killing spree!
