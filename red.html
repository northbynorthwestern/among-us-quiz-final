        <center> <p> Red’s always sus. Or at least everyone thinks they are. Even if you aren’t going on a killing spree, you can always count on someone in the chat claiming you’re sus and getting unfairly voted out. But don’t worry: You can always rage quit before or make sure that everyone knows just how wrong they were in the ghost chat.
