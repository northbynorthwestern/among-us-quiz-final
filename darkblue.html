        <center> <p> You’re usually the detective in the group chat. You take the game seriously, so you want to discover who the impostor is, or you’re willing to go to great lengths to make sure no one finds out it’s you. More people should trust you, Blue, but alas you usually end up getting killed for asking the right questions.
